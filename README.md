# Assignment-1
First assignment for Senior Project class

I attend Clayton State University working toward an Information Technology degree.  I’m excited to be only 2 semesters away from graduation!  Technology has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, and I am fortunate to currently be doing what I love as a career.  In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.  I also like to travel to the mountains of North Carolina because of the amazing views and slower pace.  I’m also a big fan of Atlanta United and watch them whenever I can.  Best of luck to you all this semester!
